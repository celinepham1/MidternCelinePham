Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
Programing language serves as the middle language between the human and the computer

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.
JDK is composed of Java run environment which and in the JRE is the JVM Java Virtual Machine and the JIT Just in Time

What is IDE?
A.
IDE is Interface Development Environment.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
Eclipse, IntelliJ, Visual Studio

Explain the entire java life cycle.
First we use an IDE to make a java file that goes through compiler to the become a class file(bytecode). That
class file goes into JIT or the JVM to become native code that Java can interpret.
what is class?
Class is a blueprint
What is object?
Instance of a class
What is the entry point of an application?
The main method
Why main is static?
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object class
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is used to compile your code and specifies the location. Classpath variables is used to look for user classes.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
The difference is that you cannot create a non abstract method in interface however you can in abstract class
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
You cannot create an Object from Interface and Abstract class and you can use it by implementation
what is Access Specifier?
It is the keywords used for accessibility in java. For example, public, default, private and protected
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP is object oriented programing. Inheritance is when a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class
Encapsulation is data hiding where no one can access easily without pur permission. Polymorphism is when methods
have different forms. For example, overloading and overriding. Abstraction is implementation hiding.
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Java Package is a essentially a folder in java used for organization. Source folder is imported by default
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
It is Application Program Interface. We have used Java API.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java does not support multiple inheritance because the compiler would get confused
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading is when methods have the same name but different data types and different number of
parameters. and it occurs in compile time.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exceptions is when there is a list a code executed and there could be an issue in the code. Exception is
telling java that when the code has an issue execute another code. It is handled using throw and try and catch
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The keyword makes the behavior or property belong to the class. Static method only uses both static variables and
methods. Non static can use static and non static
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final for variables is when you cannot reassign and final for methods is when you cannot override.
What is final, finally and finalize?
Final for variables is when you cannot reassign and final for methods is when you cannot override. Finally is
a block of code used after try and catch that is going to be executed anyway. Finalized is used garbage
collection
What is a constructor ?
Block of code that is called implicitly when the object is created
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Yes
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
default constructor
What is "this" keyword in java ?
The keyword is used to reference the global variable
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The keyword is used to refer to the superclass objects. It can be used to a instance variable, invoke the method
and constructor to the superclass
What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine
Is JVM platform independent?
Yes
What version of java are you using?
Java 11
What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is the java development kit and JVM is the java virtual machine that is a part of JDK that interprets the
code to our local machine
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE identifies the class libraries for execution and JRE decodes the class file.
What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is when the program code is converted into machine code. Run time is when the code is becoming
interpreted
What is heap?
Heap is memory used to store by running on the JVM.
How java manage it's memory?
Heap is made when it is ran in the JVM. When the heap is full, garbage is collected. And in the garbage phase,
objects that are no longer used will be cleared and more room will be made.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable and StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable. StringBuffer is threadsafe whereas
StringBuilder is not
What is Singleton class?
Singleton class is when a class has one object at a time and it is object hiding
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is converting an objects state into byte stream. Deserialization is the opposite process of turning
into memory.
when to use transient variable in java?
It is used to indicate when a field should be a part of Serialization
Difference between while and do..while loop?
Whole loop checks the condition and then executes and do while loop executes and then checks condition
What is Enum?
Enum is variables you want to create in order to be used
What is Iterator?
It is a object used to loop through collections
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer
Why is String Immutable in Java?
It is because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.
What is constructor chaining in Java?
It is the way of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Serial used single thread and Parallel Garbage Collector uses multiple threads
What is JIT stands for?
Just In Time
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Heap is made when it is ran in the JVM. When the heap is full, garbage is collected. And in the garbage phase,
objects that are no longer used will be cleared and more room will be made.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Stack is only used when methods are running and heap is used throughout the application
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties
of the program.
what is multithreading in java?
It is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
What is Framework?
It is the platform for developing applications and programs
What are the testing Framework available in java?
Selenium,jUnit,testNG
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
The difference is that jUnit is open source and testNG is java based
What are the dependencies for this project?
Maven
what is dependency injection in java?
It is a way to achieve Inversion of control in our application by moving objects binding
from compile time to runtime.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Dynamic binding is if a body of the method at runtime is bonded to a method call.
Static binding is the execution of a program where type of object is known at compile time
